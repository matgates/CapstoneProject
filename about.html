            <div id="slogan">About Us</div> 
            <p id="ipsum">Our team name is MNM, we are application development team from Nova Scotia. MNM consists of a team of three NSCC students. 
            Matt, Neil, and Michael are all second year IT Generalists creating a capstone project. For the capstone project we decided to create a web application.
            </p>

            <div id="slogan2">Our Goal</div> 
            <p id="ipsum2">This web application is designed to implement a notification system for users to receive an alert 
            when coming into proximity of an aquatic animal in a county they have pre-selected. We plan to achieve this through creating 
            a web service that users can enter their email addresses and which county within Nova Scotia they live in, that will 
            issue an image and notification of the species, tag ID, timestamp, weights, and length. This project is a proof of concept
            that proves that if we have the necessary hardware and resources we could create a fully functioning application.
            This project will be deemed successful when our RFID tags, when scanned, produce a notification utilizing database information 
            that can be delivered through our web service to registered users' email addresses. This includes a successfully deployed web service, 
            a fully functioning and interactive database, as well as hardware that has been programmed to fit our needs. 
            The project will be considered a partial success should MNM be able to implement the above, with the absence of a fully functioning 
            notification system. All other internally generated software, server-side, and client-side functionality is proven and successful.
